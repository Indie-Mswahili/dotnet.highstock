DotNet.HighStock
================
This project is an extension of DotNet.Highcharts (https://dotnethighcharts.codeplex.com)
As you know, highcharts that draw charts on web pages are becoming popular.

However, if you are a .Net C# programmer, DotNet.HighStock might be useful
We created DotNet.HighStock using open-source dotnet.highcharts.

This project started in 2014/12.
I plan to update it continuously.
